          When I drove an ATV off a mountain in Park City, I felt oddly serene as it tumbled toward the rocks and treetops below. It wasn't bravery; it wasn't even panic—it was acceptance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A neurologist later told me my brain was fine, except for anxiety, depression, and a touch of ADD. "With reasoning scores like these," he added, "you could do just about whatever you like. Have you considered law school?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But I'd already been doing something else: gambling—and winning. Reluctantly.
        </p>
        
        <hr class="my-8">
        
        <p>
          This wasn't a path I'd chosen; it chose me because my mind is inherently odd. Everything is probability for me. Every decision, every situation, and every outcome gets filtered through the lens of risk and expected value.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It's how I navigated life from an early age—<br>
          from poker tables at 16 using questionable IDs in Atlantic City,<br>
          through internships at hedge funds and Goldman Sachs,<br>
          and eventually to betting lines across major sportsbooks.
        </p>
        
        <hr class="my-8">
        
        <p>
          Before you mistake this as an invitation to follow suit, let me be explicit:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-6 italic text-xl text-red-700 my-8 bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="mb-4"><strong>The odds are overwhelmingly against you.</strong></p>
          <p class="mb-4">The house nearly always wins, and your instincts about luck and "gut feelings" are dangerously overrated.</p>
          <p>There's a 99.9% chance gambling will cost you money—and perhaps far worse.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          However, I realize some minds out there are like mine—wired differently, seeing edges where others see randomness.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For us, not gambling when there's clear expected value feels like leaving money lying on the sidewalk out of sheer laziness.
        </p>

          This site exists precisely for those rare individuals who:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Think in probabilities</li>
          <li>Live comfortably with uncertainty</li>
          <li>Want guidance on turning reluctant odds into reluctant wins</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          It also exists for those interested in understanding risk and reward through the eyes of someone who lives at the intersection of neurology, psychology, finance, and betting.
        </p>
        
        <hr class="my-8">
        
        <h2>What to Expect Here</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>📈 Educational breakdowns of +EV bets</li>
          <li>🎲 Personal stories from poker and sports betting</li>
          <li>🧠 Sharp takes on risk, psychology, variance, and value</li>
          <li>⚠️ Constant reminders not to gamble unless you're truly wired for it</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Radical transparency is my ethos. I'll call out the nonsense, separate alpha from noise, and expose the real math behind what it means to win reluctantly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you're here for the stories and not the strategies, you'll still find plenty to chew on.
        </p>
        
        <hr class="my-8">
        
        <p>
          But if you're considering gambling, let me leave you with the disclaimer upfront and center:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-6 italic text-xl text-yellow-800 my-8 bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="mb-4"><strong>Don't gamble.</strong></p>
          <p class="mb-4">The risks far outweigh the rewards for nearly everyone.</p>
          <p>But if you're determined, stubborn, or simply wired that way—stick around.<br>
          I'll show you what it means to be a reluctant winner.</p>
